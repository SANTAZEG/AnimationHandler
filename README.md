# AnimationHandler


this is mostly an example script for anyone looking to learn but you can use it, just make sure to give credit

this basically allows you to animate with keyframesequences instead of animations which makes any animation work on any game as long as you have the keyframesequence.
I was bored so I just decided to recreate roblox' animation system lol, many of the features isnt here (I'll keep it private but there is a chance I will share the one I'm keeping private)

DO keep in mind that since its not exactly built-in with roblox, it will of course be less optimized due to limitations
